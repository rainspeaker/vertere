# vertere

A system in clojure for working with poetry and verse drama. Digital humanities stuff. 

## Usage

Totally unusable at this point. 

Well actually I can use it but I haven't even... I mean I'm just storing it here while I play around with it. I haven't even *begun* to think about how someone else would use it. I haven't even cleaned up the dependencies so that other people can use it without trouble. 

I should probably do that.
